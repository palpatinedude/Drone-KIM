INITIAL JOBS PID IN X AXE : 

1. IMAGE PROCESSING REPRESENT THE EDGES AND THE CENTER OF THE ROBOT INSIDE THE LINE .
2. FIND WHERE THE ROBOT IS  AND CALCULATE THE PATH PLANNING .
3. FIND THE HORIZONTAL DISTANCE WITH THE HELP OF CENTER OF LINE AND CENTER OF FIELD VIEW(WHERE THE ROBOT IS ), FIND THE DIFFERENCE IN CM(X AXE).
4. SEND THE ERROR FROM IMAGE PROCESSING COMPONENT TO CONTROL SYSTEM (ERROR)
5. IN CONTROL SYSTEM TAKE THE ERROR IN X AXES AND DO PID TO GO TO TARGET POSITION
6. TRANSLATE PID ERROR TO MOTOR SPEED AND DIRECTIONS .

***based on sensors or camera ?

COMPONENTS : 
1. ultrasound
2. camera(optical flow 60 frames per sec) -> horizontal motion and speed 
3. pressure sensor - altitude
4. imu --> rotational and translation motion 


MOTORS (4 motors x 6 deg) --> 3 translations and 3 rotationals: 
 - command one motion without affecting the others 
1. Opposing motors spin in the same direction --> forward 
2. not yaw means all motors spinning at the same speed so to make yaw torque --> create torque by slow down one pair motors and spin the other pair up --> total force the same (hover) but sum of motor torques is non zero and drone yaw --> yaw not affect thrust


Use sensors to estimate the state of drone --> angular position ,horizontal velocity 




Notes for movement of drone : 
1. thrust accomplished by rotating and torquing a propeller which has mass, actuators generate reaction torque that is opposite direction . Put 2 motors to spin in different directions , so 4 motorthe torques from spinning the properellers will balance out and the drone will not spin
