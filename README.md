# üõ∏ Parrot Mini Drone Autonomous Navigation & Landing System (Simulink)

## üìå Project Overview

This project implements a **vision-based autonomous navigation and landing system** for the **Parrot Mambo Mini Drone** using **Simulink**. The system is divided into two primary subsystems:

- üîç **Image Processing System**  
- üß≠ **Path Planning Component**
- **Run from - KIM_DRONE_FINAL.tar.gz**

The drone navigates along a white line and detects a circular landing pad using real-time video from its front camera. It processes the image onboard, extracts navigation cues, and applies closed-loop control for accurate movement and landing.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- Enable autonomous **path following** using computer vision.
- Implement a **vision-based landing system** using shape detection.
- Use **Simulink and MATLAB** for modular design and simulation.
- Demonstrate real-time decision making using basic image processing and control logic.
- Enable **transition between flight modes** (navigation ‚Üî landing) automatically.

## üß† System Architecture

### üîµ Image Processing System

This subsystem processes the camera image and extracts navigational and landing features.

#### Key Steps:
1. **Image Input**: RGB image from drone's camera.
2. **Binarization**: Detect bright/white lines using thresholding.
3. **Noise Filtering**: Reduce false positives using neighborhood filtering.
4. **Border Removal**: Eliminate objects touching image borders.
5. **Circle Detection**: Identify potential landing pads by pixel density and size.
6. **Offset Calculation**: Determine drone‚Äôs alignment with the circle.
7. **Radar Scan**: Search image directions (0¬∞‚Äì360¬∞) to find the forward path.

#### Outputs:
- `cdet`: Boolean flag for circle detection.
- `x_last`, `y_last`: Offset from the landing pad center.
- `sum_end`: Pixel density inside the circle (size/confirmation).
- `x_incr`, `y_incr`: Suggested direction of path navigation.
- `start_end_flag`: Identifies start or end of the navigation path.

### üü¢ Path Planning Component

This component uses image processing outputs to calculate movement commands.

#### Key Features:
- Mode switching between **navigation** and **landing**.
- Generation of `x_inc`, `y_inc` (position increments).
- Calculation of `z_sp` or `z_final` for altitude control.
- Signals the flight controller to perform movement or descent.

#### Function Blocks:
- `XY_Ctrl`: Navigation direction computation.
- `XY_Ctrl_Landing`: Circle alignment and landing control.
- `Z_Ctrl`: Altitude reference setting.
- Logic blocks: Handle transitions and enable signals.

#### Control Logic:
- **If no circle**: Use radar direction for path following.
- **If circle detected**: Center using `x_last`, `y_last`; descend gradually.
- **If centered and close**: Stop horizontal movement and finish landing.
